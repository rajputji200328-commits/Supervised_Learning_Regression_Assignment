        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to examine and quantify the relationship between two continuous variables — one dependent variable (Y) and one independent variable (X). It assumes that the relationship between these two variables can be modeled using a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of SLR is:\n",
        "1. **To understand relationships:** Determine how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable.\n",
        "2. **To make predictions:** Estimate the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable.\n",
        "3. **To interpret impact:** Measure the strength and direction of the relationship using the slope coefficient.\n",
